	php artisan view:clear

2. Paste the files to default laravel installation
3. Go to your browser and type http://localhost/laravel/public
4. Start adding the data
5. Once you added a new data, please do not edit right away
   as it will not get the data to the form. You have to reload/refresh
   the page before you can edit. Once you do that, you no longer have to reload/refresh.

6. Make sure that public file permission is set to 666 or more or 777

It stores all the data in that file.
